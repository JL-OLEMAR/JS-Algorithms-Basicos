# Find The Parity Outlier

## Instructions

  - You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

## Example

```
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] // odd
[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] // even
```
